# DGD-LOCAL
These Matlab codes reproduce the figures and experimental results in the paper:

Distributed Low-rank Matrix Factorization With Exact Consensus.

Zhihui Zhu, Qiuwei Li, Xinshuo Yang, Gongguo Tang, Michael B. Wakin.

GenerateGraph.m generate the weight matrix W for a random connected network.
demo_LeastSquare.m and demo_MatrixFactorization.m are demonstrations code to solve least-square and low-rank matrix factorization problems using DGD+LOCAL.
